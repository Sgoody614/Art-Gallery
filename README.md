# Art-Gallery
I created this website to showcase all of my artwork available for sale. It is my first and only public website that I created and it is hosted by GoDaddy. 
I utilized tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap and some animations to make it more interesting. 
Currently learning more about creating a shopping cart and accepting payments to make the purchasing process easier for the users.
